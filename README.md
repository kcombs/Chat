#Chat app with Socket.io in Node

My first attempt at building a chat app using websockets and styling the front-end to see if I can make a simple but attractive chat. 

###Features to add:
* Working chat window
* User login/logout with anonymous chatting
* Private messaging
* Database for storing chats with MongoDB
* Encryption feature
